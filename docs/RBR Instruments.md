* RBR Quartz3 Sensor Naming Scheme in Oceans3.0: 
  * DART Pressure Residual: same as the above.  
  * Temperature: readings from the internal temperature sensor.  
  * Instrument Clock:  measures the BPR internal clock.  
  * P-Sensor Temperature: corresponds to the temperature measurements from the Paroscientific pressure sensor. These readings are used to calibrate the pressure measurements which are reported by the Seafloor Pressure sensor.  
  * Seafloor Pressure: pressure readings are calibrated using the Paroscientific internal temperature readings  
* Paroscientific Pressure Sensor:  
  * Temperature: corresponds to the temperature measurements from the pressure sensor  
  * Pressure: corresponds to the pressure readings calibrated using the internal temperature readings
