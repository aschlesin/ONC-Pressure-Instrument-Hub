*Purpose: To explain the "why" behind the concepts.*

* **E-01: Principles of Seafloor Geodesy**  
  * What are we measuring and why? (Tectonic strain, slow slip, tsunamis).  
* **E-02: Sources of "Noise" in Pressure Data**  
  * Why do sensors drift? (Instrumental vs. environmental).  
  * What are the non-tectonic signals? (Tides, ocean loading, seasonal cycles, tsunamis).  
* **E-03: The CORK Observatory**  
  * What is a CORK and how does it work?  
  * What's the difference between formation pressure and hydrostatic pressure?  
* **E-04: The Diátaxis Framework**  
  * A link to the official Diátaxis site.  
  * Explains *why* the documentation is structured this way.  
      
      
* Regarding NOAA and their use of our pressure sensors, Martin’s comment in GChat:  
  *Since they seem to use pressure across the board, I do not think we need to inform them immediately, as long as the data flow is not interrupted.*

  *We should make a note to create some documentation about the difference between the two sensors, and when each one is better to use.*


  *We should also check it NOAA is using the best sensors that we have at the moment.*

* Disclaimer should be added for missing DART Pressure Residual 3 hours of data
